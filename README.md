## Project Overview
As it currently stands, cross-sector partnerships between hospitals and community based organizations (CBOs) are under-performing and disoriented, leading to disparities in community-based health outreach. Additionally, workforce shortages are a top challenge for health care systems to reach underserved communities and make community-based care more accessible.

Our objective with **collabor-action** was to create the infrastructure for an online platform that streamlines communication betweeen health care sytsems and CBOs, serving as a single access point for these organizations to discover, connect and form meaningful partnerships.

We developed the following features to support this mission:

- **Organization & Employee Registration** for cross-sector visibility and communication opportunities
- **Information Cards** to allow for discovery of organizations, provide information on available services/specialties and contact information of administrative team
- **Message Form/Inbox** to promote clear communication and planning between health care systems and CBOs

## Nice-To-Have Features
Features we didn't get a chance to develop that we believe would improve the platform:
- Survey to assess the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of CBOs and healthcare systems
- Proximity map of CBOs and healthcare systems (or just list how many miles away they are) based on a specified location
- Ability to share possible collaborative events that are taking place with other organizations
- Allowing each organization to choose up to 3-5 description tags to describe themselves. They can be sorted by these tags.
