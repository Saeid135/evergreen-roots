## Project Overview
As it currently stands, cross-sector partnerships between hospitals and community based organizations (CBOs) are under-performing and disoriented, leading to disparities in community-based health outreach. Additionally, workforce shortages are a top challenge for health care systems to reach underserved communities and make community-based care more accessible.

Our objective with collabor-action was to create the infrastructure for an online platform that streamlines communication betweeen health care sytsems and CBOs, serving as a single access point for these organizations to discover, connect and form meaningful partnerships. 

We developed the following features to support this mission: 

- **Organization & Employee Registration** for cross-sector visibility and communication opportunities 
- **Information Cards** to allow for discovery of organizations, provide information on available services/specialties and contact information of administrative team 
- **Message Form/Inbox** to promote clear communication and planning between health care systems and CBOs
