## Project Overview
As it currently stands, cross-sector partnerships between hospitals and community based organizations (CBOs) are under-performing and disoriented, leading to disparities in community-based health outreach. Additionally, workforce shortages are a top challenge for health care systems to reach underserved communities and make community-based care more accessible.

Our objective with **collabor-action** was to create the infrastructure for an online platform that streamlines communication betweeen health care sytsems and CBOs, serving as a single access point for these organizations to discover, connect and form meaningful partnerships.

We developed the following features to support this mission:

- **Organization & Employee Registration** 
    - Users will be able to register their organization or themselves into our system, promoting cross-sector visibility and communication opportunities
- **Information Cards** 
    - Information cards provide users with pertinent information on an organization in the system, such as location, available services/specialties and contact information of the administrative team 
- **Message Form/Inbox** 
    - Users will be able to send and receive collaboration request forms to promote clear communication and planning between health care systems and CBOs

In doing so, we hope to facilitate clear communication and planning between these organizations to optimize the speed and outreach of health care services.

## Understanding Our Code

### License
- MIT License

### Backend
- Mainly utilizing Node.js in order to keep track of/maintain and manipulate data and information within the back-end
- Hosting the website as well the usage of databases will be done through MongoDB
- Javascript is utilized in order to connect the frontend to the backend

### Frontend
- The design was based off of the Figma prototype (linked above)
- HTML and CSS were used without any external CSS libraries
- Media Queries for phone screens is included, including a changing Navigation Bar
- Connected to the Backend through Javascript
- Currently, some initial drafts of the pages (which aren't used in the final product) are included in the folders, primarily to allow easy transfer of code (in case a reversion to previous styles was decided).

## Nice-To-Have Features
Features we didn't get a chance to develop that we believe would improve the platform:
- Survey to assess the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of CBOs and healthcare systems
- Proximity map of CBOs and healthcare systems (or just list how many miles away they are) based on a specified location
- Ability to share possible collaborative events that are taking place with other organizations
- Allowing each organization to choose up to 3-5 description tags to describe themselves. They can be sorted by these tags.

## Future iSchool Capstone Team
If youâ€™re a future iSchool Capstone team that is interested in continuing this project, **please reach out** to Anas Azeemi via email at aazeemi@uw.edu.

### Where to Start
We recommend that you do more user research with healthcare systems & CBOs to ensure the platform is meeting the stakeholders needs. This research would also be useful in priority setting the development of features. As a starting point, we believe developing the following features would improve the platform:

- Survey to assess the capabilities, strengths, weaknesses of CBOs & healthcare systems 
- Proximity map of CBOs & healthcare systems 
- Ability to share possible collaborative events 
- Allowing each organization to choose 3-5 tags to describe themselves & be sorted accordingly
