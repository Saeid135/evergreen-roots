--------------------- NOTES --------------------

- The website is not near finished, and contains the basic front-end for some of the pages.
- The interactivity and routing between the pages will be added in the next quarter
- The basic elements for the entire website have been created, allowing for the other pages to be created very quickly
- Smaller design changes, in order to get closer to the Figma prototype, will be made near the end
